        "O": "**Pseudocode:**\n```\n1. Set the cost of one magazine (COST_MAGAZINE) to $3\n2. Set the selling price of one magazine (SELLING_PRICE) to $3.50\n3. Set the number of magazines bought by Jewel (NUM_MAGAZINES) to 10\n4. Calculate the total cost of magazines bought by Jewel (TOTAL_COST) = COST_MAGAZINE * NUM_MAGAZINES\n5. Calculate the total revenue from selling all magazines (TOTAL_REVENUE) = SELLING_PRICE * NUM_MAGAZINES\n6. Calculate the gain from selling magazines (GAIN) = TOTAL_REVENUE - TOTAL_COST\n7. Display GAIN\n```\n\n**Calculation:**\n- COST_MAGAZINE = $3\n- SELLING_PRICE = $3.50\n- NUM_MAGAZINES = 10\n- TOTAL_COST = $3 * 10 = $30\n- TOTAL_REVENUE = $3.50 * 10 = $35\n- GAIN = $35 - $30 = $5\n\n####5",
